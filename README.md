# üå´Ô∏è IoT Air Quality Monitoring System

A smart IoT-based system using ESP32, DHT22, and MQ2 gas sensor to monitor temperature, humidity, and gas concentration levels. The data is sent live to a ThingSpeak cloud dashboard for visualization and historical analysis.

## üì≤ ThingSpeak Setup

1. Create a channel at [thingspeak.com](https://thingspeak.com).
2. Add 3 fields:
   - Field 1: Temperature
   - Field 2: Humidity
   - Field 3: Gas Level
3. Copy your:
   - **Channel ID**
   - **Write API Key**

Update the following in the code:

```cpp
unsigned long channelID = YOUR_CHANNEL_ID;
const char* writeAPIKey = "YOUR_WRITE_API_KEY";
